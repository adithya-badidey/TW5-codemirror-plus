# Acknowledgements
- This plugin was made possible by the TW Community on google groups(https://groups.google.com/g/tiddlywiki/).

- I started writing this plugin using the TW-Classic CodeMirror mode by [@PMario](https://github.com/pmario) which I then ported to TW5.

- Thanks to [@saqimtiaz](https://github.com/saqimtiaz) for his code for anyword-hint.js which I adapted for this.
